** Introduction **
        This assignment's purpose is to simulate a Cluster. The FEP part was
    already given to us, and we had to implement a computational Node.
        The assignment meant to implement a Node that was computing blocks of
    the result of two matrices that are to be multiplied.

** Implementation **
        Each Node holds a reference to the others, thus meaning we have a full
    mesh configuration. Also, for easier access, I held a reference to nodes in
    a square matrix.

        For communication between Nodes I used a Queue for requests on each node
    and I used a thread that waits requests and processes them. After a request
    is processed (the element from data store is received), it is pushed in the
    requester's receive_queue as a response.
        After all requests have got the response in a task, then the
    multiplication for the block is made, and the result is returned.

** Testing **
        I have tested with the given run_test.sh on a 32-bit Linux Operating
    System, and got times between 3 and 4 minutes. (I have to mention that the
    testing was done on a Virtual Machine).
        I have also tested with the given run_test.bat on a 64-bit Windows 7
    and the times were around 1 minute.
        The machine uses a Quad core Intel i7-2630QM processor.

        On FEP I have times around 1 minute and 30 seconds.
